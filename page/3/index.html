<h1 id="responsibilities">Responsibilities</h1>
<p>For each week (except for project proposal and presentation weeks),
one team will be responsible for Leading the class, one team for
writing a Blog post on the class topic, and one team for arranging
food.  See the <a href="/schedule">Schedule</a> for team responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Leading Team.</strong>  The team responsible for leading a class should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Two weeks before the scheduled class, meet briefly with me (Dave) to
discuss plan for the class. You should decide on a team leader for
this class, who will be the one responsible for making sure everyone
on the team knows what they are doing and coordinating the team&rsquo;s
efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Monday the week of the class, at least a few representatives
from the team should come to my office hours to discuss the plan for
the class.  You should come prepared to this meeting with suggested
papers and ideas about how to present them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No later than the Monday before class, send out to the class Slack group the preparation materials for the class.  This can include links to papers to read, but could also include exercises to do or software to install and experiment with, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day of class: lead an interesting, engaging, and illuminating class! This is a 2.5 hour class, so it can&rsquo;t just be a series of unconnected, dull presentations. You need to think of things to do in class to make it more worthwhile and engaging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After class: help the Blogging team by providing them with your materials, answering their questions, and reviewing their write-up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Blogging Team.</strong> The team responsible for blogging a class should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The week before the scheduled class, develop a team plan for how to
manage the blogging. One team member should be designated the team
leader for the blogging, and post on slack so we know who is
responsible. The blogging leader is responsible for making sure the
team is well coordinated and everyone knows what they are doing and
follows through on this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During class, participate actively in the class, and take detailed
notes (this can be distributed among the team).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the Tuesday following class, have a draft of the blog post ready,
and share it with the rest of the class (including the leading team
and coordinators) for comments. Details on how to prepare the blog post are on the <a href="/blogging">Blogging Mechanics</a> page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the next Friday (one week after the class), have a final version
of the blog post ready to add to the course site.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Feeding Team.</strong> The team responsible for food should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Plan among yourselves what food to bring and who is responsible.  If
you want to use my credit card to buy food, borrow it. You can stop
by Thursday afternoon to pick it up from me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring something yummy and something with caffiene, but not too messy
or disruptive, to class. A simple choice is to get a coffee
container and bagels from the bagel shop in Rice Hall (but make sure
to get the order in early enough to be ready before class). More
adventurous choices are encouraged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure to clean up the room at the end of class. If we get caught
leaving a mess, we probably will not be allowed to have food
anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save the receipts to get reimbursed, and take care of the
reimbursement. This is easiest if you just borrow my credit card and
then all you need to do is send me an image of the receipt (or hand
me a physical receipt).</p>
</li>
</ul>

  <p class="fronthead"><A href="/blogging/">Blogging Mechanics</a><br><span class="authordate">David Evans &mdash; 1 Jan 0001</span></p>
    <p>Here are some suggestions for how to create the class blog posts for
your assigned classes.  I believe each team has at least a few members
with enough experience using git and web contruction tools that
following these instructions won&rsquo;t be a big burden, but if you have
other ways you want to build your blog page for a topic let me know
and we can discuss alternative options.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Install <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.  Hugo is a static website
generator that builds a site from Markdown pages.  (With homebrew on
Mac OS X, this is easy: <code>brew update &amp;&amp; brew install hugo</code>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clone the github repository,
<a href="https://github.com/secML/secML.github.io"><em>https://github.com/secML/secML.github.io</em></a>.
This is what is used to build the
<a href="https://secml.github.io/">https://secml.github.io/</a> site.  If you are
working with multiple teammates on the blog post (which you probably
should be), you can add write permissions for everyone to the cloned
repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should create your page in the <code>web/content/post/</code>
subdirectory. You can start by copying an earlier file in that
directory (e.g., <code>class1.md</code>) and updating the header section
(between the <code>+++</code> marks) and replacing everything after that with
your content.  Don&rsquo;t forget to <strong>update the date</strong> so your page will
appear in the right order. You can put <code>draft = true</code> in the header,
so your page will not appear on the course website until it is
ready.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use multiple files (but probably only one in
the <code>post/</code> directory (this will show up as pages on the front
list).  Use the <code>web/content/images</code> directory for images and the
<code>web/content/docs</code> directory for papers.  Using images and other
resources to make your post interesting and visually compelling is
highly encouraged!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the blog page using Markdown.  Markdown is a simple markup
language that can be used to easily generate both HTML and other
output document formats.  You can probably figure out everything you
need by looking at previous posts, but for a summary of Markdown,
see <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown: Syntax</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can incorporate latex math into your markdown. Use <code>\\(</code> inline <code>\\)</code> for inline math, e.g., <code>\\( J_{min}\\}</code> and <code>$$ ... $$</code> for display math.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your post should include credits for any external material you use,
especially for any images you incorporate that you didn&rsquo;t produce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please include full references to the papers, and links to the most
definitive source available (usually this is to arxiv or a
conference site, but could be the author&rsquo;s page). You should include
additional links to relevant and useful reference or code
repositories. Its good to have an overview section at the beginning
of the post with links to all the main papers covered, and then to
have links in specific sections to what is being covered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To test the post, run <code>make develop</code> (in the <code>web/</code> subdirectory of
your repository).  This starts the Hugo development server, usually
on port 1313 (unless that port is already in use).  Then, you can
view the site with a browser at <code>localhost:1313</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you are ready, submit a pull request to incorporate your
changes into the main repository (and public course website).  Also,
send a message to me (dave) on slack, so I know the post is ready to
review.  At this stage, I will probably make some requests for
improvements, and then will post the edited version to the course
site.</p>
</li>
</ul>
