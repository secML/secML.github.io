<h1 id="responsibilities">Responsibilities</h1>
<p>For each week (except for project proposal and presentation weeks),
one team will be responsible for Leading the class, one team for
writing a Blog post on the class topic, and one team for arranging
food.  See the <a href="/schedule">Schedule</a> for team responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Leading Team.</strong>  The team responsible for leading a class should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Two weeks before the scheduled class, meet briefly with me (Dave) to
discuss plan for the class. You should decide on a team leader for
this class, who will be the one responsible for making sure everyone
on the team knows what they are doing and coordinating the team&rsquo;s
efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Monday the week of the class, at least a few representatives
from the team should come to my office hours to discuss the plan for
the class.  You should come prepared to this meeting with suggested
papers and ideas about how to present them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No later than the Monday before class, send out to the class Slack group the preparation materials for the class.  This can include links to papers to read, but could also include exercises to do or software to install and experiment with, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day of class: lead an interesting, engaging, and illuminating class! This is a 2.5 hour class, so it can&rsquo;t just be a series of unconnected, dull presentations. You need to think of things to do in class to make it more worthwhile and engaging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After class: help the Blogging team by providing them with your materials, answering their questions, and reviewing their write-up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Blogging Team.</strong> The team responsible for blogging a class should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The week before the scheduled class, develop a team plan for how to
manage the blogging. One team member should be designated the team
leader for the blogging, and post on slack so we know who is
responsible. The blogging leader is responsible for making sure the
team is well coordinated and everyone knows what they are doing and
follows through on this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During class, participate actively in the class, and take detailed
notes (this can be distributed among the team).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the Tuesday following class, have a draft of the blog post ready,
and share it with the rest of the class (including the leading team
and coordinators) for comments. Details on how to prepare the blog post are on the <a href="/blogging">Blogging Mechanics</a> page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the next Friday (one week after the class), have a final version
of the blog post ready to add to the course site.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Feeding Team.</strong> The team responsible for food should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Plan among yourselves what food to bring and who is responsible.  If
you want to use my credit card to buy food, borrow it. You can stop
by Thursday afternoon to pick it up from me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring something yummy and something with caffiene, but not too messy
or disruptive, to class. A simple choice is to get a coffee
container and bagels from the bagel shop in Rice Hall (but make sure
to get the order in early enough to be ready before class). More
adventurous choices are encouraged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure to clean up the room at the end of class. If we get caught
leaving a mess, we probably will not be allowed to have food
anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save the receipts to get reimbursed, and take care of the
reimbursement. This is easiest if you just borrow my credit card and
then all you need to do is send me an image of the receipt (or hand
me a physical receipt).</p>
</li>
</ul>
